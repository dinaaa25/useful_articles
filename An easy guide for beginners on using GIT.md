# An easy guide for beginners on using GIT :call_me_hand:

## How to use git?
1. Make a github account
2. Generate an ssh key
3. Have your project under git control
4. Use git consistently

## Why do you need an ssh key?
When making use of github you need to be logged in into your account. In other words you need to be authenticated in order to let github know that you are the user who has access to the private, remote repository. 
When using an ssh key to authenticate yourself you do not need to use your username or password anymore. 

## How to make an ssh key?   

1. Go to your terminal and type **ssh-keygen**  
     **_NOTE:_** You do not need to be in any specific folder
     **Output**: 
     >``` 
     >Generating public/private rsa key pair.  
     >Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/dina/.ssh/id_rsa):
     >```
    **_NOTE:_** This means that by default the ssh key will be stored in:   
     **/Users/dina/.ssh/** with the default name  **id_rsa**.  

<br/>

2. You can change where the key will be saved by typing the path after the double dot :

    **Example**: 
    >```  
    >Generating public/private rsa key pair.  
    >Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/dina/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/dina/.ssh/github
    >``` 
    **Output**: 
    >```  
    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    >``` 

<br/>

3. Press enter to keep an empty passphrase  

    **_NOTE:_** In order not to need a password to look at the ssh key  
    **Output**: 
    >```  
    >Enter same passphrase again:
    >```

<br/>

4. Press enter again

    > **Output**:
    >```  
    >Your identification has been saved in /Users/dina/.ssh/github
    >Your public key has been saved in /Users/dina/.ssh/github.pub
    >The key fingerprint is:
    >SHA256:9SaKGq08u+tK9uX+GXHUNCf7qqhlQ6jEGREnMBnoWfM dina@dinas-mbp.home
    >The key's randomart image is:  
    >+---[RSA 3072]----+  
    >| .+++..     + .  |  
    >|. .+ +     o =   |  
    >|. o +     o o    |  
    >| o . E . o . .   |  
    >|    + . S o o .  |  
    >|   . o o + o .   |  
    >|  o o + *   .    |
    >| o o.* o = .     |
    >|  .oX*+o+ .      |
    >+----[SHA256]-----+
    >```
    <br/>

    ### **Congrats! This is your generated key!** :smiley: 

<br/>

5. To see your generated ssh key you can continue in the same terminal window

<br/>

6. Go to the directory of the ssh key  

    **Example**: 
    >```
    > cd /Users/dina/.ssh
    >```
    **_NOTE:_** In this case the ssh key is under **/Users/dina/.ssh**  
    **_NOTE:_** Because the folder **.ssh** starts with a dot you cannot see it using the command **ls** in your terminal. Therefore use the command **ls -a**.

<br/>

7. View the ssh key within the current directory via entering **ls**

    > **Output**:
    >```
    > github          github.pub   
    >```
    <br/>  

    **_NOTE:_** When we create the **ssh** key a private/public key pair is created. We are not going in depth on how these are used internally.  
    <br/>
    **github.pub**: <br/>
    This is the public ssh key. We need to upload this key once to github in order to be able to always to authenticate to Github when making a clone, push, pull etc request without having to give a username or password. This public key is only used when connecting to a remote github repository.

    **github**: <br/>
    This is the private ssh key. You do not show this key to anyone. Whenever you make a push, pull, clone etc. you will be able to do so due to having uploaded the public key which uses the private key behind the scenes. This private key is only used when connecting to a remote github repository. 

8. Go to **your github account**. Under profile, go to **seetings**. Under settings, go to **SSH and GPG keys**. Here you can upload your **ssh key**.

    View the to be uploaded public key from the **github.pub** file:

    > **Example**:
    >```
    > cat github.pub 
    >```
    <br/>   

    > **Output**:
    >```
    > 3jdhAZZZZ.....  etc.  
    >```
    <br/> 

    Upload the output as the **public ssh key** to your github account.

    Choose **Authentication Key** as the Key type.

### You  successfully uploaded the ssh key to github! :smiley:

## How to delete an **ssh** key?

In case you have created to many ssh keys or you are not using a certain ssh key anymore, you may want to delete these keys.

1. In your command line, navigate to your home directory.   
This is where the ssh keys are always saved. 

You can view all your **ssh** keys via the command **ls** in the home directory.

> **Example**:
>```
>  github       github.pub      id_rsa      id_rsa.pub
>```
<br/>

You can delete the private **github** key and the public **github.pub** key.

> **Example**:
>```
 > rm github* 
>```
<br/>   

> **Output**:
>```
> id_rsa          id_rsa.pub      known_hosts     known_hosts.old
>```
<br/>


## Let's start using GIT! :sunglasses:

There are two ways how you can start using git. 

#

Option 1: You make a project yourself.  

Option 2: You work on an already created project.

#

### Option 1: You make a project yourself.

1. In your command line, navigate to the directory in which your project is located. We have to put this project under **git control**. 

    **Example**:
    >```
    > git init
    >```

    Now your project is under git control!

2. Now we need to push our project to github to share the project with other users. Go to your github account and create a new repository.

3. Once you created the new repository a link is created on your github account, showing you the commands to enter such as the command to connect to the **remote** (remote github server).
    **Example**:
    >```
    > git remote add origin git@github.com:dinaaa25/useful_articles.git
    >```

Ready! Now you can skip Option 2 and continue using git! 

### Option 2: You work on an already created project.

1. Clone the project.  

**_NOTE:_** This means that you create a copy of the current project to your laptop.  
You clone a project only once in the beginning. 

**_NOTE:_** Go to your command line and navigate to the directory where you wish to clone your project to. Then go to your github account and copy the **SSH URL**. You can find it under Code in your github repository.

**Example**:
>```
> git@github.com:dinaaa25/ml_cloud_coverage_prediction.git
>```

In your command line clone the project.
**Example**:
>```
> git clone git@github.com:dinaaa25/ml_cloud_coverage_prediction.git
>```

<div style="border: solid 2px #4287f5;border-radius: 5px;padding:10px">
<b><i>NOTE:</i></b>
For Macbook users: Failed cloning of the project?

You may get the following output:

**Output**:
>```
> Cloning into 'satellite-cloud-mask-nowcasting'...
> git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
> and the repository exists.
>```

In this case your just created **ssh** key is not recognized by git. 
You can enter the following debug command in your command line to see wether this is the case: 

**Example**:
>```
> ssh -v -T bitbucket.org
>```

**Output**:
>```
> .... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_dsa
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_ecdsa
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_ed25519
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
> debug1: Trying private key: /Users/dina/.ssh/id_xmss
>```

You can see that when trying to clone the project github does not search for your public key named **github** but goes through a number of default names such as **id_dsa**, **id_ecdsa**, etc. Therefore, we need to create a file called **config** to the **.ssh** directory. In this **config** file we are going to store the path to our github key. 

1. Go to the directory of your **.ssh** folder in your command line.

2. Enter the command **vim config** in your command line
**_NOTE:_** **vim** is a text editor you can use within your command line which allows you to create the **config** file. 

3. Now in the new opened field press **i** to be able to **insert** at the top in your **vim** editor.

4. Enter the following data: 
>```
> Host github.com
>       User git
>       Port 22
>       Hostname github.com
>       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bitbucket
>```

**_NOTE:_** The amount spaces before and at the end of each line is very important.

5. Press enter
6. Enter **vim** in your command line to view that the **config** file has been created.

**Output**:
>```
> github   github.pub   config    id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
>```

7. You should be able to clone your project now 

</div>

<br/>

## For both Options:
<br/>
<div style="border: solid 2px #4287f5;border-radius: 5px;padding:10px">
<b><i>NOTE:</i></b>  
On a new computer you always need to configure your email in git config to show from whom you get the git message (your account does not matter basically)

**Example**:  
**_NOTE:_** This command assigns this email to your profile for all of your projects.
>```
> git config --global user.email "yourName@example.com"
>```

**Example**:  
**_NOTE:_** This command assigns this email to the project you are currently at. Therefore, you need to navigate in your command line to the project firstly.
>```
> git config --local user.email "yourName@example.com"
>```

</div>

<br/>

1. Make a **gitignore** file  
    **_NOTE:_** Here you store all files you do not want in your git repository. This means these files of your project will not be under git control.  
    **_NOTE:_** This command means that you write the  **tmp_extracted** file name via echo to the **gitignore** file
    **_NOTE:_** You can also open **gitignore** and edit it with text 

    >```
    > echo tmp_extracted/ >> .gitignore
    >```
    <br/>

2. You can print the **gitignore** file to view its content
    >```
    >  cat .gitignore
    >```
    <br/>

3. Add all files to **Staging** via:   
    **_NOTE:_** Staging is the step when you prepare your files for a commit.   
    **_NOTE:_** Do this for each file.
    >```
    >  git add .gitignore
    >```
    <br/>

4. Perform a commit.  
    **_NOTE:_** A commit is a nicely packaged change which has been done to one or more files.  
    **_NOTE:_** You have to put a logical message within " " .   
    >```
    >  git commit -m "my commit message"
    >```
    <br/>

    **Example**:  
    **_NOTE:_** For the first commit of a project.
    >```
    > git commit -m "initial commit"
    >```

5. Push your changes to the github. This means that you update the current project for **everyone** on github. This is the final command for a change.
    **_NOTE:_** Do not worry! In case you pushed a change accidently, other users of the project can still see the previous projects in the history.

    **Example**:  
    **_NOTE:_** For the first commit of a project.
    >```
    > git push 
    >```
